# PALANTIR : Prediction Algorithm for star-pLANeT Interactions in Radio

This code has been developed for the construction of an up-to-date and evolutive target catalog, based on observed exoplanet physical parameters, radio emission theory, and magnetospheric physics embedded in scaling laws. It is based on, and extends, previous work by Griessmeier et al, A&A, 2007.
Using PALANTIR, we prepared an updated list of targets of interest for radio emissions. Additionally, we compare our results with previous studies conducted with similar models (Griessmeier,PRE8, 2017}. 
For the next steps, we aim at improving this code by adding new models and updating those already used.
